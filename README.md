# 🐶🐱 Cat vs Dog Image Classification Using CNN

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classifier that can accurately distinguish between **cats** and **dogs**.  
It is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and trained on a labeled image dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that classifies images into two categories:
- **Cat**
- **Dog**

This model uses a custom CNN architecture and has been trained using a dataset of cat and dog images.  
The final trained model is saved as `.h5` can be used for predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- ✔️ Custom-built Convolutional Neural Network  
- ✔️ High accuracy on testing dataset  
- ✔️ Preprocessing pipeline for consistent image input
