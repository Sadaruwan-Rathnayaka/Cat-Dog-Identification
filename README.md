# 🐶🐱 Cat vs Dog Image Classification Using Trancfer Learning

🚀🔥 Excited to share my latest Deep Learning project — a Cat vs Dog Image Classifier built using Transfer Learning! 🐶🐱🤖
This model leverages a pre-trained CNN architecture (Transfer Learning) to improve accuracy and training efficiency.
 By fine-tuning the final layers on a custom dataset, the model achieved an impressive 96% accuracy on test images.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that classifies images into two categories:
- **Cat**
- **Dog**

This model uses a custom CNN architecture and has been trained using a dataset of cat and dog images.  
The final trained model is saved as `.h5` can be used for predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- ✔️ Custom-built Convolutional Neural Network  
- ✔️ High accuracy on testing dataset  
- ✔️ Preprocessing pipeline for consistent image input  
- ✔️ Easy-to-use prediction script  
- ✔️ Dataset loading + augmentation included  
- ✔️ GitHub-friendly project structure  

## 🧠 Model Architecture (Summary)

- Convolution Layers  
- MaxPooling Layers  
- Dropout Layers  
- Dense (Fully Connected) Layers  
- Sigmoid Output
